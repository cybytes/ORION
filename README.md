# ORION
ORION is an open-source, distributed, platform and storage independent database system that provides both document and relational database features at very high speeds. It also provides advanced features to store and retrieve objects, with the additional feature that objects can be instantiated inside the database without the program it belongs to. This allows much more advanced techniques for complex constraints, filters, indexes and triggers: I.e. the limit isn't a language like SQL, but the much richer programming language of the class.   The database itself is written in C# as it has many advantages and is a very powerful, consistent and intuitive language that is an open-standard. It also allows users to compile .NET scripts to be natively compiled within the system, providing rich and very fast options for plug-ins, triggers, constraints and queries.
